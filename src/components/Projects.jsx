    achievements: [
      "Implemented a queue system using BullMQ for background image processing tasks, improving scalability and task management.",
      "Set up worker processes that listen to the queue and process image transformation tasks asynchronously, ensuring high performance for batch processing.",
      "Optimized API responses by leveraging Redis for caching image transformation results, reducing processing time.",
      "Utilized Google Cloud Storage (GCS) for secure image storage and retrieval, ensuring reliable and scalable cloud-based storage.",
      "Implemented a robust webhook system to send updates on image processing status.",
      "Designed an error-handling and retry mechanism for failed webhooks and tasks in the queue.",
